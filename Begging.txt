; Begging 1.0 for ZuluHotel Omega.
;
; 1. Stand next to an NPC, make sure you have line of sight.
; 2. Start the script, target the NPC when asked.
; 3. ???
; 4. Profit
;
; Additionally, This has a small check to restart begging after a world save,
; in case the save hangs the script.  I also run this in tandem with a Razor
; macro that spams LastTarget because there are times when the target "hangs"
; outside of world saves for a reason unknown to me.


event SysMessage Please target the unfortunate npc.
