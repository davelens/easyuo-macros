; Blacksmithing 0.1 for ZuluHotel Omega.
;
; 1. Have ample iron ingots in your backpack
; 2. Go to a house you own or co-own.
; 3. Have 2 tiles of room to the west to place the deed.
; 4. Start the script.
;
; This raises your Blacksmithing from 90 onwards, crafting iron breastplates.
; IMPORTANT: For now, this script depends on a Razor macro to handle the menu
; responses (Just record one yourself). You could accomplish the same with
; located clicks in EasyUO, but haven't had time to do this yet.
